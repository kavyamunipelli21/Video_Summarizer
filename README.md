Here is the  Video Summarizer that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's language model, Lang Chain, and Stream lit to provide a streamlined and efficient solution for summarizing Video lectures. 
The OpenAI language model enhances the natural language processing capabilities of the summarizer, allowing for accurate and contextaware summarization. Lang Chain, a powerful tool for linguistic analysis, 
complements the OpenAI model, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the video content. The integration with Stream lit facilitates a user-friendly interface, enabling users to easily interact with and customize the 
summarization process. This innovative combination of technologies offers a sophisticated solution for content creators, researchers, and learners seeking to quickly extract key insights from Video lectures.

Technologies used are :

Python — Primary programming language.
Streamlit — Framework for building the web interface.
YouTube Transcript API — For fetching video subtitles from YouTube.
Google Gemini AI — For summarizing the text (generative AI model).
LangChain — For splitting long transcripts into manageable chunks..
OpenAI  — Placeholder for OpenAI model usage.
API Key Management — Handling API keys .
